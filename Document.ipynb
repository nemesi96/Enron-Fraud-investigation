As part of the assignment, you should attempt to engineer your own feature that does not come ready-made in the dataset -- explain what feature you tried to make, and the rationale behind it. (You do not necessarily have to use it in the final analysis, only engineer and test it.) In your feature selection step, if you used an algorithm like a decision tree, please also give the feature importances of the features that you use, and if you used an automated feature selection function like SelectKBest, please report the feature scores and reasons for your choice of parameter values.

    "Validation is essentially a procedure of seperating a test data collection from the training data and applying the selected model on the test set to see more reasonable outcomes .A classic mistake is testing your algorithm on similar data that was already trained. Without isolating the preparation set from the testing set, it is hard to decide how well your algorithm sums up to new data.My last model was approved by seperating 30 for each penny of whole information for test set utilizing train_test_split and other was utilizing analyzer work in tester.py which utilizes StratifiedShuffleSplit Method. Stratified rearrange split cross-approval is a converge of StratifiedKFold and ShuffleSplit, which returns stratified randomized folds. Stratification is the process of rearranging the data as to ensure each fold is a good representative of the whole. For example in a binary classification problem where each class comprises 50% of the data, it is best to arrange the data such that in every fold, each class comprises around half the instances. \n",

    "I likewise utilized tester.py's Stratified Shuffle Split cross validation as a substitute strategy to gage my algorithms's execution. Since the Enron data  is so small, this sort of cross validation was valuable since it basically made different datasets out of a solitary one to get more exact outcomes."
